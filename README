This program converts between 10 and 13-digit ISBN (EAN).
ISBN is the number tracking system for books. The old standard was 10-digit ISBN,
whereas the new standard is an EAN based 13-digit system.

The program takes input from the command line, seperated by spaces.
Example:
isbn 0132404168 9780132404167

Yields the following output:
9780132404167
0132404168

To provide input from a file, pipe through xargs:
cat somefile | xargs isbn
